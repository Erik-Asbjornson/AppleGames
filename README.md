The game is for Mac

Currently the only goal of the game is do not kill yourself and it is a sandbox game because I ran out of time to add enemies.

The seed only affects terrain nothing else.

The controls are arrow keys for left, right, and jump.
The e key opens inventory and the q key throws the selected hotbar item away from you.
