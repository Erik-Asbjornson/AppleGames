The game is for MacOSX.

Currently the only goal of the game is do not kill yourself and it is a sandbox game because I ran out of time to add enemies.

The seed only affects terrain nothing else.

The controls for movements are arrow keys for left, right, and jump.
If you double tap the left or right arrow you will start sprinting which is faster than normal walking, but it consumes hunger.

You use the left mouse button to break blocks, and you use the right mouse button to place blocks and eat food.

The e key opens inventory and the q key throws the selected hotbar item out of your hotbar.

Music is from https://mega.nz/#!FcVSQRwZ!uVVjmov8rQaWtATpapx5mF2pdj5GvV3-s40EK33pATQ.

Other sounds made by me.
